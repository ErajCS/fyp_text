Seeds: 
• Tiny, elongated, dark-colored 
• Used primarily for large-scale 
commercial cultivation 
• Allow selection for specific traits (disease 
resistance, size, shape) 
• Broader genetic base improves 
adaptability 
• Take longer to grow and may produce 
variable bulb sizes 
• Growth period: 4-6 months 
First, let's look at seeds. These tiny, dark-
colored propagules are the foundation of 
large-scale commercial onion cultivation. 
They offer genetic diversity, allowing 
growers to select for desirable traits like 
disease resistance and bulb characteristics. 
While seeds take longer to mature—typically 
4 to 6 months—they provide greater 
adaptability to changing conditions, though 
with some variability in the final product.

Bulbs (Main or Storage Bulbs): 
• Mature, enlarged underground parts for 
consumption or planting 
• Can be planted directly as "sets" for new plants 
• Advantages: quick establishment and uniformity 
• May carry diseases if not properly selected or stored 
• Growth period: 2-3 months

Bulbs (Main Or Storage Bulbs)
Next are mature bulbs, which serve dual 
purposes as both food and planting 
material. When planted as "sets," these 
bulbs establish quickly and produce 
uniform crops in just 2 to 3 months—
significantly faster than seeds. However, 
careful selection and storage are essential, 
as these bulbs can potentially carry 
diseases from one generation to the next.

Small Bulbs (Offsets Or Bulbils)
Small Bulbs (Offsets or Bulbils) 
• Tiny bulbs formed in the leaf axils 
• Used for vegetative propagation true to 
parent type 
• Faster than seed propagation with high 
uniformity 
• Popular for home gardening and rapid 
multiplication 
Small bulbs, also called offsets or bulbils, are 
miniature versions of the main bulb that form in 
the leaf axils. These are particularly valuable for 
vegetative propagation because they remain 
genetically identical to the parent plant. Offsets 
combine the speed advantages of bulb 
propagation with exceptional uniformity, making 
them ideal for both home gardeners and 
commercial growers seeking consistent results.

Flower Heads: 
• Flowering parts that produce 
seeds after pollination 
• Used for seed production and 
breeding 
• Often removed in cultivation to 
encourage bulb growth 
Finally, flower heads represent the 
reproductive stage of the onion 
plant. While essential for seed 
production and breeding programs, 
they're frequently removed in 
commercial cultivation to redirect 
the plant's energy toward bulb 
development. Understanding when 
to allow flowering versus when to 
prevent it is a key management 
decision for onion growers.

Using Large Bulbs for Propagation 
Let's examine how large bulbs can be used for propagation, which is a common practice 
in many growing regions. It may be noted that most local onion varieties are not 
propagated with mature bulbs due to bolting risks. Instead, seeds, sets, or transplants are 
used. To use large onion bulbs as a seed, multiplier onion varieties are used.

Multiplier Onion Varieties
Multiplier Onions: Clusters, Not Bulbs - Why standard onions won’t multiply, and which 
varieties thrive globally: 
Multiplier onions are unique varieties that form clusters of bulbs instead of a single bulb like 
standard onions. First, a critical distinction: common onions (Allium cepa) focus energy on 
bolting and seed production, yielding zero new bulbs when replanted. Multiplier onions, 
however, multiply vegetatively, creating 5–10 bulbs per plant through division or aerial 
bulbils. 
Key Varieties: 
1. Potato Onions: These underground multipliers (similar to shallots) thrive in tropical 
regions like Thailand, Indonesia, and India, where they’re grown year-round for domestic 
and export markets. In the U.S., they’re prized for long storage – up to a year. 
2. Walking Onions: Known for aerial bulbils that ‘walk’ as they root, these are niche crops 
in North America and Russia, often used for pickling or scallions. 
3. I’itoi Onions: Drought-tolerant heirlooms from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., 
essential for grilled cebollitas de cambray at Mexican BBQ spots. 
4. Lorient Multiplier: A UK-bred hybrid from seed, gaining traction in Canada and Europe 
for disease resistance and gourmet flavor 
Commercial Hotspots: 
•
Southeast Asia: Thailand and Indonesia lead in potato onion exports. 
•
India: Major producer of pungent multipliers for regional cuisine. 
•
Brazil & Mexico: Grow multipliers for superior taste over standard onions. 
•
North America/Europe: Revival efforts focus on heirlooms like Garnet Mountain and 
Green Mountain for permaculture. 
Why Standard Onions Fail: 
Vidalia or common onions prioritize flowering (bolting) when replanted, wasting energy on 
seeds, not bulbs. Multipliers avoid this by evolving to divide, making them ideal for 
sustainable farming.

Large Bulb Process: 
• Large bulbs have lateral buds or "eyes" that 
grow into new shoots 
• Shoots develop into new plants with their 
own root systems 
• Original bulb acts as a starter for the new 
plant 
The large bulb contains lateral buds or "eyes" 
that sprout into new shoots when planted. These 
shoots quickly develop their own root systems, 
with the original bulb serving essentially as a 
nutrient reserve to jump-start growth—like a 
built-in starter package for the new plant.

Large Bulb Advantages: 
• Faster establishment with more uniform crops 
• Quicker harvest time compared to seed propagation 
• More predictable bulb sizes 
• Higher total productivity per season due to shorter growth cycle 
Plants established from bulbs develop more rapidly and uniformly than those 
grown from seed. The predictable bulb sizes and shorter growth cycle 
translate directly to higher seasonal productivity, making this method 
particularly attractive for commercial operations with time constraints or 
multiple cropping seasons.

Offset Production: Using Small Bulbs (Offsets) for Commercial Production 
Now let's focus on what many consider the optimal propagation method for 
commercial production: using small bulbs or offsets.

Youtube.Com/@Pedaverpqnk3167/Videos 
Offset Advantages: 
• Genetically identical to parent plant 
ensuring uniform crops 
• Cost-effective compared to large 
bulbs or seeds 
• Rapid multiplication capability 
• Reliable with less variability for 
easier crop management 
As clones of the parent plant, offsets 
produce exceptionally uniform crops 
with predictable characteristics. They're 
more cost-effective than both seeds and 
large bulbs, while offering rapid 
multiplication potential. The reliability 
and reduced variability simplify crop 
management decisions, reducing risk and 
labor costs.

Offset Collection Process 
1.Collect after main crop matures and 
begins to die back 
2.Carefully dig around main bulb 
3.Gently separate offsets using clean 
tools 
4.Remove soil and debris; trim roots if 
necessary 
Timing is crucial—harvest offsets when 
the main crop has matured and begun to 
die back. Use careful digging techniques 
to avoid damage, and gently separate the 
offsets with clean tools to prevent 
disease transmission. Final preparation 
involves cleaning away soil and debris, 
with minimal root trimming if necessary.

Offset Storage 
1. Air-dry for a few days in a cool, 
ventilated place 
2. Store at 4-10°C (39-50°F) in mesh 
bags or containers with good airflow 
3. Best planted soon after harvesting 
for maximum viability 
After collection, allow offsets to air-dry 
for several days in a cool, well-ventilated 
environment to reduce moisture content 
and prevent rot. For longer storage, 
maintain temperatures between 4 and 10 
degrees Celsius in breathable containers 
to ensure proper airflow. However, for 
best results, plant offsets as soon as 
possible after harvesting and processing.

Offset Planting Guidelines: 
1. Timing: Early spring or late fall depending on 
climate. 
2. Soil: Well-drained, fertile soil with organic 
matter. 
3. Depth: 1 inch deep, pointed end up. 
4. Spacing: 4 inches apart rows and plant to plant 
in rows.  
5. Maintenance: Consistent low moisture managed 
by mulching. 
Planting should be timed according to your local 
climate—typically early spring or late fall. Prepare 
well-drained, fertile soil enhanced with organic 
matter. Plant offsets at a depth of 1 inch with the 
pointed end facing upward. Maintain proper 
spacing of 4 inches between plants in rows that are 
4 inches apart. After planting, ensure consistent 
moisture, diligent weed control by maintaining 
organic mulch to conserve water and suppress 
weed growth.

speed and uniformity for commercial production. Small 
bulbs or offsets excel in producing highly uniform crops 
at the lowest cost, though without genetic diversity. The 
choice ultimately depends on your specific growing 
objectives, timeline constraints, and available resources.

PQNK System for Allium Production
PQNK System for Allium Production 
Applying PQNK System in Onion and Garlic Production 
Steps for Conventional to PQNK Transition: 
1.
Create laser-levelled plots in flatland areas for efficient machinery operation 
2.
Break the hardpan (compacted soil layer 8-22" deep) to improve water/air infiltration 
3.
Flood irrigate to leach salts/chemicals and reconnect soil layers for expanded root networks 
4.
Make 42" wide raised beds with 18" furrows (for 60" tractor tracks) for controlled traffic 
5.
Plant cover crops to improve soil porosity, temperature regulation, and microbial activity 
6.
Mulch mature cover crops without disturbing soil and root systems 
7.
Plant onion/garlic propagules at 4" spacing (row-to-row and within rows) yielding 235,224  
bulbs/acre 
8.
Eliminate fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides—no purchased inputs required 
9.
Minimal irrigation needed with proper mulch; maintain only 35% water-filled soil pores 
10.
Harvest when 60% of plant leaves turn yellow 
Note: This system works identically for both onion and garlic cultivation, making it versatile for 
all allium crops.
This slide introduces the PQNK Pristine Organic farming system for onion and garlic production. Both crops respond exceptionally 
well to this identical approach. This regenerative system begins with laser-levelling and breaking the hardpan—that compacted layer 
restricting water and air movement. After flood irrigating to leach unwanted chemicals, raised beds are created with specific 
dimensions to accommodate machinery while minimizing soil compaction. Cover crops play a crucial role in improving soil structure 
before being mulched in place. Allium crops are then planted at precise spacings to maximize yield without overcrowding. One of the 
most remarkable aspects of this system is the elimination of purchased inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. With proper mulching, 
irrigation requirements are dramatically reduced, and harvest timing is guided by observing the natural yellowing of plant leaves. This 
system represents a complete paradigm shift from conventional cultivation to regenerative practices for all allium family crops.

Growing Baby Onion Sets: A Practical Guide for Reliable Harvests
To grow onion sets—a method where immature bulbs are stored and replanted for reliable harvests: 
First, the process: You start by densely sowing onion seeds in a nursery. After 8–12 weeks, when bulbs reach about 
half an inch in diameter, you uproot them. These mini-bulbs are cured in warm, dry conditions for 1–2 weeks, then  
stored at 4 to 8 C until replanting. 
Critical factors: Bulb size is key. Half-inch bulbs  
reduce bolting risks, while larger ones may flower  
prematurely. Storage must balance low temperatures  
and controlled humidity to prevent rot. 
Why do this? It’s cost-effective—farmers save on seeds  
and skip the slow seedling stage. It also minimizes  
soil-borne diseases compared to replanting mature bulbs. 
But challenges exist: Even small sets can bolt if  
temperatures fluctuate. Storage requires precision—too  
damp, and bulbs rot; too warm, and they sprout early. 
Global success: In tropical climate, short-day varieties thrive as sets. Meanwhile, Europe’s Stuttgarter sets dominate 
cooler regions. 
Compared to multiplier onions, sets yield one large bulb per plant, while multipliers like shallots split into clusters. 
Sets require more labor but offer uniformity. 
To succeed: Choose climate-adapted varieties—short-day for warm regions, long-day for cooler zones. Rotate crops 
to avoid disease buildup. 
In summary, onion sets bridge efficiency and tradition, offering growers control over their supply chain. With careful 
execution, this method ensures predictable, high-quality yields."
