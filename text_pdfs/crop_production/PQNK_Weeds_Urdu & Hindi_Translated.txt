Crowfoot Grass - ﮐﮭﺒﻞ ﮔﺎس 
Farmer-to-Farmer Conversation on Crowfoot Grass in a PQNK Field
When a PQNK farmer mentions "Crowfoot Grass," people often panic. They see it spreading and think it’s a problem. But look closely — nothing harmful is happening here. 
Crowfoot Grass only grows where the soil is bare or compacted; it loosens the soil and then naturally dies off. We didn’t plant it — it grew naturally along the water channel.
Look at the root layer: I’m standing on it myself, and you can feel how soft and sponge-like it is, about 5 to 6 inches of living layer now. Now look at the crop. 
Not just one plant, but the whole orchard. 
All the plants are fruiting, sprouting new branches, and the fruit is completely clean — no pest marks, no wilting. I’ve never seen such healthy, large fruit with traditional methods. 
People think that when we stop applying fertilizer, the weeds will steal nutrients, but here the plants are thriving. 
There’s no deficiency because soil microbes are converting dead roots and soil particles into plant food. I’ve shut down the fertilizer store — now the field itself is a fertilizer factory. 
Roots strengthen the soil from within, like rebar in concrete. Every soil type needs specific roots — fibrous, medium taproots, deep taproots, and spreading roots. 
Together, they maintain balance and moisture in the soil. Weeds aren’t enemies but soil servants. 
They make the soil stable, breathable, and fertile for crops. 
Don’t destroy them; use them to revive your land.
Every weed is a remedy for a specific disease:
Crowfoot Grass smooths the surface
Coriander digs channels
Together, they turn the soil back into a ‘sponge’ that absorbs rain, allows air circulation, and gives life to plants. 
Let the roots work — and don’t see weeds as enemies, but as nature’s engineers.
