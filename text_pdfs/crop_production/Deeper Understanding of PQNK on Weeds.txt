Crowfoot Grass - ﮐﮭﺒﻞ ﮔﺎس 
Farmer-to-Farmer Conversation on Crowfoot Grass in a PQNK Field
Whenever a PQNK farmer mentions Crowfoot grass, people panic. They see it spreading and think it’s a problem. But look around
—nothing here is being harmed. Crowfoot only shows up where the soil is bare or compacted; it loosens the ground, then disappears 
on its own. We didn’t sow it—nature did, right beside the water channel. Look at this mat of roots: I’m standing on it and you can 
feel how spongy it is. At least five to six inches of living ‘foam’ has formed. Now check the crop. Look at every plant in the orchard, 
not just one. They’re fruiting, putting out new shoots, and the fruit itself is flawless—no insect scars, no shrivelling. I have never 
seen fruit of this size and quality under conventional farming. See this one in my hand? That’s today’s calibre—praise God. People 
worry the weeds will steal nutrients once we stop synthetic fertiliser, but the plants are thriving. There’s no shortage at all because 
the microbes are turning those dead roots and mineral particles into plant food. I’ve closed the fertiliser shed; the field itself is now 
the fertiliser factory.

Crowfoot Grass - ﮐﮭﺒﻞ ﮔﺎس 
The plant commonly known as “ﮐﮭﺒﻞ 
ﮔﺎس” (Khabal Ghaas) in Urdu/Punjabi is 
known in English as Crowfoot Grass 
English Name: Crowfoot Grass 
Botanical Name: Dactyloctenium 
aegyptium 
Description: It is a tough, drought-
resistant grass. 
• Commonly found in dry lands, 
roadsides, and farm boundaries in the 
Indian subcontinent. 
• It is also used for forage, erosion 
control, and traditional medicine in 
some cultures. 
Root System: Crowfoot grass has a 
fibrous root system. 
Root Depth: 
• Typically penetrates 15 to 45 cm (6 to 
18 inches) deep in most soils. 
• In loose or sandy soil, roots may 
extend up to 60 cm (2 feet) deep. 
• It is known for being a surface-
spreader, forming a mat of roots that 
grip the upper soil layer, making it 
useful in preventing erosion.

How Roots “Stitch-Up” Damaged Soil – a Farmer-
Friendly Walk-Through
Soil Is Really Just “Rock + Pores + Glue”
Soil ingredient
Job in the field
What goes wrong when it's lost
Mineral grains (sand, 
silt, clay)
Skeleton that holds 
everything
Bare grains pack tight under rain 
& traffic
Pores (air gaps & water 
channels)
Highway for water, air, 
roots, microbes
Collapse → water puddles, roots 
suffocate
Glue (organic matter & 
root exudates)
Keeps crumbs loose but 
connected
Without plants, glue decays → 
crumbs fall apart
Think of bare, compacted soil as a torn piece of cloth: it’s full of rips (cracks), pulled threads 
(collapsed pores) and holes (lost organic matter).  Weeds are nature’s emergency sewing kit.  
Their roots slide between the soil particles, re-open blocked pores, and leave behind organic 
“stitches” that hold water, air and nutrients in place.
Roots = live re-bar 
As roots wiggle through the mineral grains they push them apart, squirt out sugary exudates that 
stick crumbs together, and leave behind hollow straw-like channels when they die.  Those 
channels become instant infiltration pipes for the next rainfall.

What the root does
Soil problem it

Fine, fibrous net
Crowfoot grass 
(Khabal gass),

A tight carpet <15 - 40 cm deep that

slowing evaporation and holding 
sand in place
Blowing sand, top-

Medium "candle" 
taproot
Mustard, wheat, 
barley 
Bores 40-60 cm, cracks hardpan, 
leaks exudates that feed microbes 
and loosen clay
Shallow compaction 
layer, waterlogging
Deep "bio-drill" 
taproot
Chicory, dandelion, 
pigeon-pea, Jantar
Shoots 1 m+ to open vertical shafts, 
mines deep minerals and lifts them 
to the top in its leaves
Tight sub-soil, 
drought-prone fields
Stolon / runner 
roots
Bermuda grass, 
purslane
Spreads sideways, arm-locking soil 
crumbs and shielding soil from sun
Bare, sun-baked 
patches
When all four root types grow together they form a three-dimensional root web: 
• Top net slows rainfall splash and seals in moisture. 
• Mid-layer roots punch lateral pores and feed soil life. 
• Deep drills connect the water table to the surface.

How It Works in Different Soil Textures
How It Works in Different Soil Textures
Soil texture
What farmers see
How root diversity fixes it
Sandy (large pores, 
water drains fast)
"Rain disappears in 
an hour; plants wilt 
by noon."
Fibrous mats (e.g., crowfoot grass) knit grains together; 
exudates coat sand with biofilm that grabs water like a 
sponge. Taproots follow moisture downward and retrieve 
it later.
Loam (balanced)
"Gets crusty after 
heavy rain, but 
recovers."
Keep a living mix to maintain balance; roots renew pores 
faster than wheel traffic collapses them. Occasional mow 
but no bare fallow.
Clay / compacted
"Water stands, 
tractor ruts stay for 
weeks."
Bio-drill weeds crack the clay, roots pry open plates, dead 
roots leave vertical "pipes" for next rain. Surface fibrous 
weeds stop the clay from sealing again.
Weeds appear only where soil is bare or compacted—they are nature’s first-aid crew. 
They open pores, supply organic matter, and leave once the soil sponge is rebuilt. Under 
a PQNK system, soil microbes turn those decayed roots and mineral particles into plant-
available nutrients, so weeds are partners, not competitors, and every crop gets what it 
needs without scarcity.

Weeds: The Unsung Heroes of Soil Restoration 
From Degraded Compacted Soil to Sandy Pores—How Weeds and 
Roots Heal the Land
Practical Tips to Harness (Not Fight) Weeds 
	
1.	
Watch the indicator species 
• Crowfoot grass = soil wants a shallow fibrous net. 
• Pigweed / amaranth = soil gasping for deep cracks. 
	
2.	
Mow, roll or graze – don’t plough them under straight away:  
•
Cutting leaves on top keeps the root mass alive long enough to finish the soil-repair job. 
	
3.	
Follow with a seeded cover:  
•
Mix cereals (fibrous), legumes (mid tap), and a couple of deep brassicas or radish (bio-drill). 
	
4.	
Avoid continuous bare soil: Each month without living roots is a month of pore collapse and carbon loss. 
	
5.	
Traffic smart: Run tractor tyres or livestock lanes in the same tracks; let the untrodden strips stay alive.

The Take-Home Story You Can Share
Every weed is a doctor for a different soil illness: 
• Crowfoot stitches the surface blanket. 
• Dandelion drills the drainage holes. 
• Together they rebuild the sponge that soaks up rain, stores it, and breathes air to our crop 
roots. 
Keep that living root diversity working 365 days a year, and your soil turns from hard brick 
or leaking sand into a soft, moist, crumbly cake ready for high-yield crops with no fertilisers, 
pesticides and less irrigation. 
Turn weeds from enemies into unpaid soil engineers — and let the roots do the heavy lifting.
