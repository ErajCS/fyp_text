Advisory Paper – Mango Pruning

Topic: Mango Orchard Pruning for Healthy Growth and Yield Improvement
1. Introduction
Pruning mango trees according to scientific and environmental principles is essential for maintaining healthy growth, increasing fruit production, and ensuring the trees can tolerate climatic changes. PQNK recommends pruning as a key step for sustainable mango farming.
Mango trees, like all living systems, respond to environmental stimuli such as temperature, humidity, and light. Proper pruning helps balance these factors and ensures the trees remain healthy and productive for many years.
2. Environmental Role of Pruning
Pruning plays an important role in maintaining a balanced environment for the tree. By controlling canopy density and removing unnecessary branches, it allows sunlight and air to penetrate properly, reduces pest and disease pressure, and promotes new, healthy shoots.
It also improves photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, and helps in regulating the hormonal balance within the tree, which is essential for consistent fruiting.
3. Suitable Season for Pruning
The best season for pruning mango trees is winter, when the trees are in a dormant phase and there is less sap flow.
This typically falls between December and mid-February, depending on the region.
Avoid pruning during high temperatures or heavy rainfall.
Pruning during dormancy allows the tree to recover before flowering begins in spring.
4. Pruning Technique
a. Step 1 – Removal of Dead or Diseased Wood
Remove all dead, diseased, and damaged branches.
Clear the area around the base of the trunk to prevent infection.
Dispose of infected material away from the orchard.
b. Step 2 – Thinning for Air and Light
Trim overlapping or inward-growing branches to open the canopy.
Allow sunlight and air to reach all parts of the tree.
This reduces humidity and disease risk, improving fruit quality.
c. Step 3 – Height and Shape Control
Maintain a moderate tree height to facilitate management and harvesting.
Shape the tree into a balanced, open form (umbrella or vase shape preferred).
d. Step 4 – Tool Hygiene
Always use clean, sharp tools.
Disinfect cutting tools after use to avoid disease spread.
5. Fertilization and Soil Health After Pruning
After pruning:
Apply organic compost or well-rotted manure around the base.
Supply micro and macronutrients as needed to boost regrowth.
Irrigate adequately but avoid overwatering.
Maintaining soil fertility is key to strong regrowth and healthy flowering after pruning.
6. Mango Tree Response to Pruning
After pruning, trees channel their energy toward new shoot growth.
Healthy regrowth improves:
Flower initiation and fruit set.
Resistance to pests and diseases.
Overall productivity and fruit size.
Regular pruning also helps balance vegetative and reproductive growth, leading to higher and more consistent yields.
7. Key Precautions
Never prune during active flowering or fruiting.
Do not over-prune; excessive cutting weakens the tree.
Always prune in dry, sunny weather to prevent fungal infections.
Burn or bury removed diseased branches away from the orchard.
