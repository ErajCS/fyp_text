The Living Soil: Why Your Orchard Floor is as Important as Your Trees
A Simple Guide for a Thriving Citrus Orchard with PQNK
Your citrus trees provide shade, but the real magic happens on the ground. A cover of
living plants (weeds/grasses) or dead mulch is the key to unlocking your soil's natural
power. Never leave soil bare!
Four Reasons to Always Cover Your Soil
1. Awaken the Soil's Kitchen
2. Harvest Water from the Air

layer.
Your soil already has all the food your
trees will ever need, locked away in the
sand and minerals. A layer of mulch is the
food that wakes up the tiny life (microbes)
in the soil. These microbes are the "cooks"
that prepare this food and serve it to your
tree's roots, perfectly balanced. Without
mulch, the kitchen is closed.
The mulch layer acts like a sponge. It catches
morning dew and absorbs moisture directly
from the air, especially when it's humid. This
creates a constant, gentle supply of water for
your plants. This natural watering system is
often enough to meet your trees' needs,
dramatically reducing or even eliminating the
need for drip irrigation. Mulch is a water
harvester.
3. Build a Natural Army
4. Create the Perfect Home for Roots

A healthy, mulch-covered soil is full of life,
including friendly bacteria (like BT) that act
as bodyguards. They live with your plant and
protect it from harmful insects and diseases.
This natural defense system is stronger than
any chemical spray and keeps your trees
healthy from the inside out. Mulch builds a
free army.
Bare sand gets dangerously hot in the sun and
cold at night. This stresses your tree's roots. A
mulch cover acts like a blanket, keeping the
soil temperature stable and cool. It also
provides a dark, moist, and airy environment
where roots can grow strong and healthy, just
like in a natural forest. Mulch is a safe home
for roots.
The Golden Rule of PQNK Farming:
Feed the soil, not the plant. A living soil covered with organic mulch will take care
of everything your citrus trees need to thriveâ€”nutrients, water, and protection. The
shade from the tree is a bonus; the cover on the ground is the engine.
