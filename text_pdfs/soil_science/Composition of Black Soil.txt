Natural Ways To Amend Black Soil (Without Agrochemicals)
What Makes Black Soil Black? 
The black color of black soil comes 
primarily from: 
1. Iron & Manganese Oxides 
Iron oxide (Fe₂O₃) and manganese 
oxide (MnO₂) coat soil particles. 
These dark minerals give soil a deep 
brown to black hue. 
2. Presence of Organic Matter 
Though organic content is low, even 
small amounts of decomposed plant 
material (humus) can darken the soil. 
3. Chemical Weathering of Basalt 
Rocks 
Black soil forms from the weathering 
of volcanic basalt rocks. These rocks 
contain dark-colored minerals rich in 
iron, magnesium, and alumina, which 
tint the soil black over time. 
4. Moisture Retention 
Black soil holds water very well. 
When moist, it appears even darker 
due to water film on clay particles. 
Farmer-friendly summary: 
"Iron, volcanic rock dust, and just a 
touch of humus – that's what paints the 
soil black and makes it so fertile!"
