Soil Moisture Management in PQNK Organic Farming
The 30/70 Rule: Key to Success 
Optimal Soil Balance: 
• 30% water-filled pores 
• 70% air-filled pores 
Benefits of Proper Moisture Management 
• 90% reduction in water usage 
• No need for chemical fertilizers 
• Natural pest protection through BT 
bacteria 
• Higher nutrient density in crops 
Warning Signs of Over-Irrigation 
• Excessive vegetative growth 
• Increased pest vulnerability 
• Reduced crop yield 
• Lower nutritional quality 
Making the Right Furrow Irrigation Decision 
1. Check soil moisture before irrigation 
2. Consider recent rainfall patterns 
3. Observe plant indicators 
4. Remember: Less water often means better 
results 
PQNK Principle: 
"Soil health determines plant health. Balanced 
moisture ensures balanced growth."
At the heart of our approach is what we call the 30/70 Rule. This represents the ideal balance in your soil: 30% of pore space filled with water, and 70% filled with 
air. This precise balance creates the optimal environment for beneficial soil microorganisms and healthy root development.
When you maintain this balance, the benefits are substantial. First, you'll reduce water usage by an impressive 90% compared to conventional methods. The well-
structured soil with broken hardpan allows for efficient water infiltration exactly where it's needed.
Perhaps most importantly, this balance eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers. Why? Because the thriving microbial ecosystem converts minerals already 
present in the soil into forms perfectly balanced for plant uptake. Additionally, Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria flourish in these conditions, providing natural pest 
protection by producing proteins toxic to many common pests but safe for the crops and beneficial insects.
Be vigilant for warning signs of over-irrigation. If you notice sudden, excessive vegetative growth, this indicates the plant is likely struggling with mineral uptake. 
This often leads to increased pest vulnerability as plant tissues become softer and more attractive to insects. The end result? Reduced yields and lower nutritional 
quality in your harvest.
When making furrow irrigation decisions, always check soil moisture levels first. Consider recent rainfall patterns and observe your plants carefully for signs of 
stress. Remember our PQNK principle: less water often means better results. The hardpan-free beds with organic mulch cover create natural pathways for proper 
water infiltration and aeration.
By mastering Soil Moisture Management rather than traditional irrigation, you're not just growing crops – you're cultivating a living soil ecosystem that works in 
harmony with your plants to produce nutrient-dense, resilient harvests.
Remember: in PQNK farming, soil health determines plant health, and balanced moisture ensures balanced growth.
