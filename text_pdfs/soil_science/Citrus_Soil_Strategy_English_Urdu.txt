Introduction to yellow sand dunes: 
Yellow sand dunes are loose, low in fertility, and drain water quickly. 
Although citrus trees can grow in this environment, the soil must be 
improved to support water retention, microbial life, and root stability. This 
guide provides practical steps to transform yellow sand into a productive 
growing base using local plants and natural inputs. 
Soil Strategy for Citrus in Yellow Sand Dunes: 
English Version 
1. Focus on developing a living root system within the top 4 feet of the soil. 
2. Grow a mix of Crowfoot Grass, Sunhemp, and Jantar to create a diverse root network. 
3. These plants will help bind the sandy soil, reduce erosion, and maintain surface structure. 
4. Their fibrous and taproot combinations improve water retention and create bio-pores for 
air and water movement. 
5. These living roots activate microbial activity in the soil, which in turn improves fertility. 
6. Mulch the area with dry grass, sugarcane waste, or leaves to preserve moisture and 
regulate soil temperature. 
7. Utilize your existing drip irrigation to water deeply and less frequently, keeping the upper 
layers active. 
8. Spray compost tea or vermiwash every 15â€“20 days to support microbial health. 
Optional: Add rock phosphate or natural minerals to support citrus during the early growth 
phase.
