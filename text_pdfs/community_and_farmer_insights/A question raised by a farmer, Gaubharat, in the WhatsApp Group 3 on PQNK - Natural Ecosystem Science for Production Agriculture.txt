Thank you Dr. Sir. I learn something from every single thing you say. You said a very good thing about what a farmer should 
be and what is his religion. Dr. Sir, I want to know from you, what kind of a farmer should be in your opinion? Like, in every 
profession, it is said that a teacher should be an ideal teacher. What should a father be like? What should a scientist be like? 
What should a citizen be like? What should a soldier be like? Similarly, what should a farmer be like? What is your opinion 
about that? What do you think a farmer should be like? Because in today's world, people give respect to a farmer only on his 
name. Before eating, a farmer should be given respect. Before sleeping, a soldier should be given respect. People say this. 
But whenever it comes to buying something, they treat the farmer like this. In any other profession, we never treat the doctor 
like this. And we all say that the farmer is not getting anything. But when it comes to giving money, when it comes to buying 
something, they insult him a lot. If something goes wrong, if a mango or a fruit goes wrong, they treat him like a storm. But 
this behavior is not usually done by people in other professions. But people insult the farmer every day in the society. And in 
such situations where the atmosphere is not supportive, where farmers are using so many chemicals and pesticides, in such a 
situation, being an organic farmer, when we play without using poison, people ask us why our rate is high. When we were 
not on a picnic, our cost of production was very high. So, even today, there are people who respect farmers. But the rate is 
very low. So, how can we keep our motivation high in such a situation? And as humans, what should we think about the 
earth, air, and water? What should we give to the world and nature? As humans, as farmers, what is our duty? What should a 
farmer be like? In such a negative atmosphere, we have to feed only those who do not behave well with us. But the other 
professions that treat them badly, like doctors who operate without work, they are respected. But we are doing well, but we 
do not get the respect we deserve. So, in such a situation, we have to do good for them. We have to feed them well, so that 
they can live a healthy life. So, how can we be ideal farmers in such a negative situation? In your words, in your opinion, tell 
us something that will motivate us to live with pride. Even if we do not get the same response from society. Our inner pride 
should be as good as we can give something good to the world and nature.

A Question Raised by a Farmer, Gaubharat, in the WhatsApp Group 3 
on PQNK - Natural Ecosystem Science for Production Agriculture

Your words carry deep wisdom and a heartfelt struggle that resonates with every farmer who toils with love for the land yet 
faces indifference from society. You are right—farmers are the backbone of civilization, yet they are often undervalued, 
exploited, and disrespected in the modern economy. But despite this, your role is sacred, and your duty is profound. Let me 
share my thoughts on what an ideal farmer should be, not just in action but in spirit.   
1. A Farmer Should Be a Guardian of the Earth   
The first duty of a farmer is not just to grow crops but to protect the soil, water, and air. An ideal farmer understands that 
the land is not just a resource but a living entity. When you farm on PQNK - Natural Ecosystem Science for Production 
Agriculture, avoiding inundation of soil with water, don’t disturb soil with tillage, don’t apply chemicals, and keep soil 
covered with organic mulch, you are healing the earth rather than exploiting it. This is not just agriculture—it is a form of 
worship. Even if society does not recognize it today, history will remember those who preserved the land instead of 
poisoning it for short-term gains. 
2. A Farmer Should Be a Teacher of Truth   
People have forgotten where their food comes from. They pay more for a mobile phone than for the grains that sustain their 
lives. An ideal farmer must educate society—not with anger, but with patience. When someone asks why your PQNK 
produce is expensive, explain with dignity: "Because I refuse to poison the land or your health for cheap prices." Every 
time you stand by your principles, you plant a seed of awareness.   
3. A Farmer Should Be a Warrior of Patience   
Unlike other professions, farming is a test of endurance. A soldier fights with weapons; a farmer fights against storms, 
droughts, market crashes, and ungrateful consumers. Yet, you still feed them. That is your strength. An ideal farmer does 
not seek immediate rewards but finds pride in resilience. Remember, the world survives because farmers wake up every 
day and try again, no matter how unfair the system is.

4. A Farmer Should Be a Healer, Not Just a Producer   
Doctors heal individuals; farmers heal entire communities. When you grow food without toxins, you are preventing diseases. 
When you protect the soil, you are ensuring clean water and air for future generations. An ideal farmer knows that his work 
is not just about profit—it is about legacy.   
5. A Farmer Should Be Proud, Even If the World Doesn’t See It 
Society may disrespect you today, but deep down, people still know: "No farmer, no food." The ones who bargain harshly 
with you will still pray before eating—because somewhere in their hearts, they know the truth. An ideal farmer does not wait 
for external validation. His pride comes from knowing that without him, civilization would collapse.   
6. A Farmer Should Be a Philosopher of Life   
Farming teaches the deepest lessons—patience, sacrifice, and the cycle of life and death. An ideal farmer understands that 
his struggles are not just about money but about meaning. When you sow a seed, you are participating in creation itself. No 
corporate job can give that fulfillment.   
Final Words: Keep Your Pride Alive   
You asked how to stay motivated in such an unfair world. The answer is this: You are not just a food producer; you are a 
preserver of life. When you feel disheartened, remember:   
- The earth remembers your care.  
- The future generations will bless you.   
- Every seed you plant is an act of faith.  
Society may not pay you well today, but history will honor you. Keep farming with conscience. Let your work be your 
message. And remember—the best form of respect is not given by others; it is the respect you hold for yourself.  
Stay strong, Farmer. The world needs you more than it admits.
