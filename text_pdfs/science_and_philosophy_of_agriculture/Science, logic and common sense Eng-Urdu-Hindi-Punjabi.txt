Science, logic and common sense
•
Science, logic, and common sense are three essential tools that humans use to understand and navigate the world 
around us. Each of these tools has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and they complement each other in 
important ways. 
•
Science is a systematic and evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world. It involves the use of the 
scientific method, which involves forming hypotheses, testing those hypotheses through experiments and 
observations, and drawing conclusions based on the results. Science allows us to develop a deep understanding 
of the natural world and make predictions about how it will behave in the future. 
•
Logic is a tool that we use to make sense of the world around us. It involves thinking logically and rationally, 
making clear and reasoned arguments, and identifying flaws in arguments made by others. Logic allows us to 
make sound decisions and avoid making mistakes based on faulty reasoning. 
•
Common sense is a collection of practical knowledge and experience that we accumulate over time. It includes 
things like intuition, heuristics, and gut feelings. Common sense allows us to make quick, instinctive decisions 
based on our past experiences and knowledge of the world, without having to rely on lengthy calculations or 
complex reasoning. 
•
While each of these tools has its strengths, they also have their limitations. Science, for example, is limited to what 
can be observed and measured, and may not be able to provide answers to questions that are beyond the scope of 
empirical investigation. Logic, on the other hand, can be used to make sound arguments, but it can also be used to 
justify flawed reasoning if the premises are incorrect. Common sense can be helpful in many situations, but it 
can also lead to biases and errors in judgment. 
•
Despite their limitations, science, logic, and common sense are all essential tools that we use to understand and 
navigate the world around us. By combining these tools and using them in a complementary way, we can gain 
a more complete and accurate understanding of the world, make sound decisions, and avoid common pitfalls 
and errors in judgment.
