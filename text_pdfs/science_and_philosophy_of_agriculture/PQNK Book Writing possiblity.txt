Book Title: PQNK Farming: The Future of Organic Agriculture 
Lets us create Historic book on PQNK Farming by Dr. Asif sharif sir. 
A book which has 1 stop solution of each agriculture need. 
 
✅ Step 1: Structure Approval 
• 
Use the proposed 7 Parts and 44 chapters as the official framework. 
• 
Invite inputs from the group to add any missing topics before finalizing the skeleton. 
 
✅ Step 2: Team Formation 
• 
10–15 contributors from the PQNK community Old PQNK farmer, Soil science, 
Biology, chemistry expert, AI Expert, Computer expert. 
• 
Roles for each person: 
o Research Contributor – Collects references, data, real-life case studies. 
o Chapter Draft Writer – Prepares initial raw draft. 
o AI Editor (You or someone skilled) – Polishes draft using AI for flow, 
language, and presentation. 
o Reviewer Group – Cross-checks facts and PQNK principles. 
o Coordinator – Tracks progress, manages file sharing, and timelines. 
 
✅ Step 3: Workflow 
1. Assign Chapters: 
Each contributor picks 2–3 chapters (depending on interest and expertise). 
2. Collect Material: 
o Use existing PQNK videos, documents, Asif Sharif Sir’s lectures, and field data. 
o Add new learnings and real-world results. 
3. Create Raw Draft: 
o Simple language, point-wise, no worry about grammar. 
o Include images, diagrams if possible. 
4. AI Polishing: 
o AI (like me) converts raw drafts into professional chapters instantly. 
o Adds proper flow, headings, and clarity. 
5. Internal Review: 
o Group reviews for accuracy and completeness. 
6. Dr. Asif Sharif Review: 
o Share final compiled soft draft to Sir for corrections and suggestions only once 
to save his time. Let final decision to be taken with all right to dr sahab & with 
their name if he wish can publish as book to mankind. 
7. Finalization: 
o Apply corrections and format as high-quality PDF (Soft Book). 
8. Phase 2 (2–3 Years): 
o Expand with case studies, pictures, farmer success stories, and advanced 
research for the final printed edition. 
 
✅ Step 4: Technology & Collaboration Tools 
• 
Google Docs or Notion – For collaborative writing. 
• 
Drive/Dropbox – For resource storage (images, videos, PDFs). 
• 
WhatsApp/Telegram Group – For coordination. 
• 
AI Tools (ChatGPT) – For editing, formatting, and professionalizing content. 
• 
Canva/Adobe Express – For designing book layout and infographics. 
 
✅ Step 5: Why This Will Be Historic 
• 
First community-built organic farming book integrating AI + practical farmer 
knowledge + PQNK science. 
• 
A reference for global farmers, not just India. 
• 
Will establish PQNK as the world’s most advanced, scalable, and sustainable 
farming technique.
