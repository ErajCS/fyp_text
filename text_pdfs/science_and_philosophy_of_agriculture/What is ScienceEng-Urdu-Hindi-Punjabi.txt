What is Science?
Science is a systematic and logical approach to discovering how the natural 
world works. It involves using the scientific method, which is a process of 
asking questions, formulating hypotheses, and testing those hypotheses 
through observation and experimentation. The goal of science is to produce 
knowledge, which can be used to explain and predict natural phenomena.

• Agriculture is a unique sector that has not benefited from the application of science to 
understand the natural provision and protection systems. Instead of building upon 
natural ecosystems, research has focused on destroying them and highlighting 
deficiencies to promote the repeated sale of so-called agricultural inputs. 
• As a result, the manipulation of natural algorithms that govern soil fertility and 
vegetation has had devastating consequences, affecting everything from soil and water 
quality to the environment and the cost and quality of food. Farmers and consumers 
have suffered, while input supply companies have flourished. 
• It is time to reassess our approach to production agriculture and work towards 
supplementing, rather than substituting, natural processes. We must recognize the 
importance of building and supporting natural ecosystems to facilitate sustainable and 
profitable agriculture. By doing so, we can ensure the well-being of farmers, 
consumers, and the environment while promoting the long-term success of the industry.
