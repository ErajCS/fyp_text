 
Deeper Understanding of PQNK – The Science of 
Natural Ecosystems for Production Agriculture 
An esteemed professor at a leading U.S. university—a long-time associate and advocate of 
the System of Rice Intensification (SRI)—initially connected with us in 2008 during our 
pioneering trials of growing rice on raised beds in moist (rather than waterlogged) soil. 
While researching alternative methods, we discovered SRI and found that many of its 
principles aligned with our existing practices. We adopted SRI’s recommended spacing (8" 
× 8") and shared our results internationally, forging a collaborative relationship. 
However, during one of our exchanges, I noted that SRI, while beneficial, lacks a robust 
scientific foundation—a perspective he understandably questioned. This sparked a series of 
thought-provoking discussions, which we’ve included here to provide context for the deeper 
exploration of PQNK that follows. 
PQNK—Production Agriculture through Natural Ecosystem Science—is not merely an 
alternative practice but a paradigm rooted in the self-sustaining principles that have 
governed thriving ecosystems for over 400 million years. This document traces our 
dialogue, the scientific distinctions between PQNK and conventional methods, and the 
evidence supporting our approach. 
======================== 
The 1st email in this thread that I received: 
  
My response: 
There are a few exchanges in between, but I am moving to the point where it gets 
interesting: 
In response to the followup email, I wrote an email explaining the reasons for my such 
understanding, which is placed below: 
Dear Norman, 
I am not disputing the benefits that SRI has provided in alleviating poverty, particularly 
among smallholder farmers. However, we must view this within the broader context of 
human technological progression. 
The Evolution of Agricultural Practices: Consider how humanity has progressed in 
transportation: we relied on our legs for millions of years, then domesticated animals and 
used horses as the fastest travel method. We subsequently invented bicycles, which 
substituted for animals, then advanced to motorbikes, cars, and ultimately aircraft. While 
recognizing the benefits of air travel, the majority still relies on land-based transportation 
due to accessibility and convenience. Each technological step was beneficial at the time of 
its introduction and served large populations well. 
Similarly, SRI represented an improvement over conventional rice production systems. 
Traditionally, rice was cultivated in low-lying areas where water naturally gathered and 
inundated the soil. In irrigated areas, conventional practice involved breaking the inundation 
cycle to maintain moist soil conditions and promote better tillering. 
SRI's Development and Limitations: The $15 million funding transformed SRI into what we 
see today. However, as I have mentioned previously, SRI is not a science-based process—it 
is a modest improvement on existing practices, particularly for areas requiring irrigation. 
While I do not challenge the benefits SRI has provided to numerous farming communities, 
its fundamental steps lack scientific grounding. 
The natural algorithms of soil fertility and vegetation form ecosystems where uplands 
support vegetation and lowlands support water and aquatic life forms. Rice and certain other 
plants adapted to survive in water-inundated soil conditions, leading us to believe this was 
the optimal growing method. However, if this were true, why does SRI recommend 
maintaining moist (not inundated) soil conditions to encourage tillering? 
Nature has precisely designed each plant to achieve its optimal potential. Water serves as a 
mineral carrier, and plants absorb only what they transpire. If rice required more water, it 
would have evolved broader leaves and would be planted during periods of lower humidity, 
not during peak humidity seasons. A simple comparison demonstrates this: when examining 
two rice plants in the same field—one growing in inundated conditions and another on a 
raised border designed to facilitate irrigation—the plants on raised borders consistently 
produce more tillers. 
Every drop of water that bypasses the root hairs not only represents waste but also damages 
plant potential, soil health, and soil microorganisms. 
Research Independence and PQNK: From the beginning, I decided against accepting grants 
and donations from governments or financial institutions, including the World Bank and 
FAO. My concern was that funding comes with strings attached, limiting research freedom 
and practical adoption. I have been offered substantial sums for PQNK propagation, which I 
have refused. 
The distinction between funded research and self-funded research is crucial. Most research 
receives financial support, with donors often selecting subjects and expecting results that 
favor their organizational objectives.  
The Research-Funding Complex: A problematic intermediary system has emerged between 
donors and researchers or extension entities. Operators within this system actively seek 
sellable topics that are attractive to funders, deliberately building cases through strategic 
content creation. They employ credible and well-known writers, leverage prestigious 
publications, and organize compelling presentations to promote their chosen narratives. 
However, most of such data is not truly representative of ground realities. 
This creates a cycle where research priorities are driven by funding appeal rather than 
genuine agricultural needs. The intermediaries craft attractive proposals using established 
names and platforms, but the resulting studies often lack the independence necessary for 
objective scientific inquiry. The data presented, while appearing credible due to the 
reputation of its sources, frequently fails to reflect the actual conditions and challenges 
faced by farmers in the field. 
This approach has contributed to our current challenges: soil degradation, climate issues, 
increased production costs, reduced nutritional density in food, and poverty among farming 
communities. 
Consider the current state of agriculture: farmers are abandoning the profession, being 
replaced by large corporations. Today's farmers are often those with limited alternative 
employment options. 
The PQNK Solution: PQNK is reversing this trend. A significant number of young people 
from farming families are returning to agriculture and achieving remarkable success in 
producing high-quality food at low production costs. 
The Critical Question: The fundamental question remains: Should we continue with 
incremental improvements on conventional practices, or should we adopt science-based 
production systems that address all current challenges? 
Two major factors require urgent promotion: 
1. Breaking the hardpan formed by mechanization, which has disrupted the natural water 
cycle 
2. Maintaining optimal soil temperature, as current practices contribute to planetary 
warming 
The choice between gradual improvement and transformative change will determine the future of 
sustainable agriculture and food security. We stand at a critical juncture similar to past agricultural 
transitions, where we must choose between augmenting agricultural practices that evolved over 
thousands of years without regard to natural ecosystems, or following the naturally designed 
production systems that have sustained life for over 400 million years without depleting resources 
or generating waste and pollution.

The final question answer in the email gets really interesting, placed below: 
Full text, my answers are in Bold/Italic: 
Dear Asif, 
Thank you for these. I will study them more carefully, but my first look raised a 
question in my mind about tillage. 
  
I agree with you that we should be aiming for no or minimum tillage for the reasons 
that we both know. No disagreement there. 
  
But if I think like a plant, I know that there are advantages to my seed being sown 
in ploughed soil rather than in ‘natural’ soil because my roots can more easily 
penetrate and flourish in ‘disturbed’ soil than in ‘undisturbed’(hard, solid) soil. 
Thank you for raising this interesting question. While it may seem that 
ploughed ("disturbed") soil offers easier penetration for roots, the reality is 
that tillage disrupts the soil’s natural structure and ecological balance, 
ultimately making it less hospitable for plant growth compared to untilled 
("natural") soil. Here’s why: 
Ploughing breaks down soil aggregates into fine particles, collapsing the pore 
spaces that roots, water, and air depend on. Over time, this leads to 
compaction beneath the tilled layer (hard-pan), restricting root growth. 
Additionally, tillage accelerates the decomposition of organic matter, 
releasing stored carbon and degrading the soil’s ability to retain water and 
nutrients. The loss of microbial networks—especially mycorrhizal fungi—
further weakens nutrient uptake, while the destruction of earthworm 
channels and old root pathways removes natural corridors that aid new root 
development. 
Moreover, bare, tilled soil is prone to extreme temperature fluctuations, often 
exceeding 70°C in warm climates, which burns organic matter and kills 
beneficial soil life. Without protective cover, water evaporates rapidly, 
drawing up salts and increasing surface salinity. The disrupted soil structure 
also reduces water infiltration, leading to runoff and erosion. In contrast, 
undisturbed soil—rich in organic matter and microbial activity—remains well-
aerated, retains moisture efficiently, and provides a balanced, sustainable 
nutrient supply. 
While ploughing may offer short-term ease of planting, its long-term effects—
loss of fertility, increased erosion, and reduced biodiversity—make natural, 
minimally disturbed soil far more conducive to healthy plant growth. 
Sustainable practices like no-till farming, mulching, and cover cropping 
preserve these benefits while still ensuring productive agriculture. 
It needs to be taken into account that disturbed soil also makes it easier for the 
roots of ‘weeds’ (other plants) to grow. But that does not change the fact that 
untilled soil is not as hospitable germination and root growth. 
You raise an excellent point about weeds thriving in disturbed soil, but their 
presence is not a flaw—it’s a function. Weeds are often mislabeled as foes 
when, in reality, they are ecological allies. They emerge where soil is 
degraded—bare, compacted, or lacking microbial life—to perform vital 
restorative work: their roots break up hardened soil, rebuild pore spaces, and 
regulate temperature by shading the ground. 
Conventional systems see weeds as competitors because they assume a 
finite pool of synthetic fertilizers must be rationed. But in natural systems 
(PQNK), where microbes—not chemicals—mediate nutrient cycling, the 
dynamic shifts. Soil microbes unlock minerals from organic matter and rock 
particles, converting them into plant-available forms in balanced proportions. 
In this context, weeds aren’t “stealing” resources; they’re co-participants in a 
system where all plants—crops and weeds alike—access what they need 
without scarcity. 
Tillage and herbicides might suppress weeds temporarily, but they 
exacerbate the very conditions that invite weed colonization: soil collapse, 
biodiversity loss, and microbial starvation. Untilled soil, rich in organic matter 
and microbial networks, naturally regulates plant communities, reducing the 
need for intervention. Over time, as soil health improves, weed pressure often 
declines because the ecosystem no longer requires “pioneer” plants to mend 
its wounds. 
I’ve attached a video and slide that illustrate this process visually—how 
weeds act as soil’s healing agents and how no-till systems harness their 
benefits while minimizing disruption. 
If the ‘natural’ soil is truly ‘organicized’ with a lot of life in it, it will be friable and 
have a lot of channels through which water and air (O2) can penetrate to lower 
horizons, and undesirable gases like H2S can be vented (evacuated). Lots of 
earthworms make for lots of  channels, but other arthropods and invertebrates also 
work the soil to make it penetrable for roots as well as for water and air. 
You’re absolutely right—a truly "organicized" natural soil, teeming with 
biological activity, becomes self-structuring and optimally porous. 
Earthworms are indeed the most visible engineers, creating macropores that 
enhance drainage, aeration, and root penetration. However, they’re just one 
part of a much larger ecosystem at work: 
•
Fungal Networks: Mycorrhizal hyphae bind soil particles into stable 
aggregates while creating micro-channels for water and nutrient flow. 
•
Arthropods & Microfauna: Mites, springtails, and beetles mechanically 
break down organic matter, while their burrowing complements 
earthworm channels. 
•
Root Systems: Living and decaying roots (from crops and weeds alike) 
leave behind biopores that act as highways for future roots, gases, and 
water. 
•
Microbial Activity: Bacteria secrete glues (like glomalin from fungi) that 
stabilize aggregates, preventing compaction even under pressure. 
This biological web ensures that oxygen reaches deep layers, toxic gases 
(e.g., H₂S) diffuse out, and water infiltrates rather than pools—eliminating the 
need for mechanical tillage. Crucially, such soils resist compaction because 
their structure is dynamic: as old pores collapse, new ones are formed by 
ongoing biological activity. 
The contrast with tilled soils is stark: tillage provides short-term friability by 
brute force, but at the cost of destroying the very organisms that maintain 
porosity naturally. Over time, this leads to dependency on repeated 
disturbance. In contrast, nurturing soil life creates a self-renewing system 
where friability, aeration, and drainage persist without intervention. 
  
My question is perhaps a small one, but I think that there are a lot of soils that even 
in natural conditions are pretty compacted, to an extent that ploughing is beneficial 
for plant growth – but weeds as well as crops. Ploughing can also contribute to 
compaction, certainly with heavy machinery. 
Your observation about naturally compacted soils is important—yes, some 
ecosystems (like low-lying areas with poor drainage) develop extreme 
hardness due to salt accumulation and organic matter depletion. When 
rainwater runs off into these zones, it carries dissolved salts; evaporation 
then concentrates them at the surface, choking soil pores, raising pH, and 
creating a hostile environment where only a few resilient weeds survive. 
However, while ploughing might temporarily fracture such compacted layers, 
it’s a short-term fix with long-term costs: it accelerates organic matter loss, 
exacerbates salinity by bringing deeper salts upward, and—as you noted—
heavy machinery worsens subsoil compaction. 
PQNK’s regenerative approach addresses the root causes without relying on 
tillage: 
1.
Land Leveling & Hardpan Breaking: Laser-leveling ensures even water 
distribution, while subsoiling (a one-time mechanical intervention) 
breaks the hardpan without inverting layers. 
2.
Salinity Flushing: Adding diluted sulfuric acid (10 kg/ac) neutralizes and 
solubilizes salts, which is applied with irrigation to leach down salts. 
3.
Permanent Raised Beds: Elevating beds prevents waterlogging, while 
their undisturbed structure encourages root and microbial activity. 
4.
Cover Crops & Mulch: Fast-growing covers (e.g., sunn hemp, Junter) 
rebuild organic matter, and their retained roots create biopores. 
Aboveground biomass acts as mulch, regulating temperature and 
moisture. 
The result isn’t just short-term friability—it’s a lasting recovery. We’ve 
regenerated barren fields where salts once crusted the surface into 
productive soils teeming with life, all without recurring tillage. The key is 
working with biology: roots and microbes maintain porosity, while mulch 
buffers against re-compaction. 
  
This comes back to soil physics and biology, which have been eclipsed by the 
preoccupation with soil chemistry, looking only at the supply of nutrients rather 
than the FLOW of nutrients. 
You’ve pinpointed the critical issue: modern agriculture’s overemphasis on 
soil chemistry—reducing fertility to mere nutrient supply—has obscured the 
deeper roles of soil physics (structure, porosity, water dynamics) and biology 
(microbial mediation, nutrient cycling). 
In PQNK, we flip this paradigm: 
•
Biology Replaces Chemistry: Instead of force-feeding soluble 
fertilizers, we nurture microbial communities that regulate nutrient 
flow. Fungi and bacteria convert minerals from organic matter and 
rock particles into plant-available forms as needed, preventing 
leaching and imbalance. 
•
Physics Enables Flow: Healthy soil structure (maintained by roots, 
fungi, and earthworms) ensures oxygen, water, and nutrients move 
efficiently to roots—no chemical surplus required. 
Attached is a slide illustrating how just of total soil minerals (in sustainable 
forms) can meet crop demands when biology orchestrates their release. 
Compare this to conventional systems, where 90% of applied NPK is lost to 
runoff or volatilization! 
The takeaway? Soil isn’t a passive warehouse of nutrients—it’s a living, self-
regulating system. By prioritizing biology and physics, PQNK achieves 
resilient fertility without chemistry’s dead ends. 
  
Anyway, I put this before you to work in more consideration of soil physics and 
biology to ‘unpack’ the issue of tillage. 
Thank you for this thoughtful guidance—we fully agree that the tillage debate 
cannot be resolved without rigorously "unpacking" the interplay of soil 
physics and biology. 
To confirm: we’ve done exactly this homework—deeply and systematically. 
Over the past 17 years, PQNK’s protocols have been stress-tested across 
thousands of acres under radically diverse conditions: 
•
Topography: From floodplains to sloping fields, observing how 
biological systems manage water without tillage-induced erosion. 
•
Soil Types: Clay-heavy compacted soils, sandy low-CEC soils, and 
saline wastelands—all regenerated through physics-biology synergies. 
•
Crops: Annual cereals, perennials, and horticultural crops, tracking 
root adaptation to undisturbed soil structures. 
The results consistently show: 
1.
Physics in Action: Fungal hyphae and root networks replace tillage by 
creating stable macropores (0.5–2 mm diameter), achieving optimal bulk 
density (1.1–1.3 g/cm³) without mechanical loosening. 
2.
Biological Pumps: Mycorrhizae extend root reach 100x, accessing deep 
nutrients and water—proven via isotopic tracing (attached data). 
3.
Scaled Success: Yields match or exceed conventional tillage within its 
few crops, with almost zero input costs. 
  
I am fully on board with CA (esp. if one is ceasing flooding of soil, which fills up 
channels in the soil water, expelling air in the soil, and changing the structure of 
soil, its aggregation and aeration. 
All the best, 
Norman 
============================ 
In this exchange, Professor Norman raised profoundly insightful 
questions—the kind only deeply knowledgeable minds can articulate. 
His challenges compelled us to articulate PQNK’s principles with 
even greater rigor, for which we are sincerely grateful. 
This dialogue underscores a critical truth: PQNK is not merely a 
farming method, but the reactivation of Earth’s original operating 
system—a proven biological framework that has sustained over 1.5 
million lifeforms across 400 million years. Today, we’ve translated 
this ancient wisdom into scalable science, validated across diverse 
soils and climates. 
To farmers and scientists reading this: you stand at a threshold. 
Understanding these principles means joining a paradigm shift—from 
battling nature to collaborating with it. The results speak for 
themselves; the opportunity is now yours to test and witness.
