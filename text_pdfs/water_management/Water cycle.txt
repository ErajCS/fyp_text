Look, you’ve come up with a very good idea. We’ve already been 
working on this and educating people about it. 
Regarding water: every drop of water Allah has sent to Earth is 
preserved. None of it is wasted. It exists in different forms—
liquid, gas, vapor, salty water, fresh water, ice, or snow. Water 
simply changes from one form to another. 
What happened is that when we began industrial agriculture, a 
hard layer formed beneath the soil—called a “hardpan.” This pan 
typically starts around 7–8 inches and extends up to 18–20 inches 
deep. It’s a compact layer that allows neither air penetration nor 
water absorption or infiltration. 
As a result, we only use the top 5–6 inches of soil by tilling it. 
The soil beneath is disconnected by the industrial agriculture 
systems. When water is applied, it only saturates the top layers. 
Air escapes, which leads to plant issues—since plants need both 
moisture and aeration. 
When air escapes: 
	•	 Microbial communities die. 
	•	 Anaerobic conditions emerge. 
	•	 Harmful enzymes and bacteria flourish, damaging plants. 
In PQNK the Pristine Organic farming system, the first step is to 
break the hardpan. Once broken, rainfall is absorbed into the 
soil—it doesn’t run off or evaporate, but remains stored in the 
field. 
Over the past 30–40 years, groundwater levels have plummeted 
from 20–30 feet to over 250–300 feet. We pumped out water, 
but due to hardpan, it didn’t recharge the aquifers. 
As a result, trillions of tons of extra water are now floating in the 
atmosphere as vapor and gas, severely disturbing the climate. 
Bare soil heated up to over 70°C. When hot air rose, it pushed 
cooler layers outwards, altering weather patterns. Cold regions 
saw increased rain, snowfall, hurricanes, and erratic seasons. 
The key benefits of PQNK system: 
	1.	 All rainfall is absorbed into the soil. 
	2.	 Mulch prevents evaporation. 
	3.	 Only the necessary amount of water is used. 
This reduces irrigation needs by 80–90%, and in many cases, 
eliminates the need altogether. 
Allah has created a natural irrigation system through rain, dew, 
and humidity—without prevailing irrigation methods. 
Plants require moist soil, not excessive water. Water acts merely 
as a carrier to dissolve and transport minerals through 
osmosis, and it’s absorbed via fine hair-like roots in tiny 
quantities. 
This is a significant subject with long-term benefits. Reflect on it. 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
