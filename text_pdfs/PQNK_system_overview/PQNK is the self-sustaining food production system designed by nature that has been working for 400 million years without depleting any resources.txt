Question: By practice every 2nd year farmers 
here in Thatta apply one truck (approximately 6 
to 10 MT of cow manure) in one acre. 
The soil here is mostly silty clay and therefore it 
is said that the manure helps to improve soil 
texture. As well as provide a little bit of npk. 
After land Prep the manure is dropped onto the 
land in mounds (photo below) and spread with 
chali. Then 1 last culti is done followed by release 
of water and rice sowing.  
Should we stop this practice entirely or fine tune 
it to the above recommendation?
Side-by-Side Comparison Chart of Farmyard Manure and the Aerobic Compost
Component
Farmyard Manure
Aerobic Compost
Primary 
Ingredients
Animal excreta (dung, urine) from 
livestock (e.g., cows, horses, poultry)
Green waste (e.g., vegetable scraps, grass 
clippings) + Brown waste (e.g., dry leaves, 
straw, cardboard) and animal waste
Bedding Material
Straw, sawdust, wood shavings, or 
other absorbent materials used in 
animal stalls
Not typically included, but straw or dry 
leaves may be added as carbon source
Carbon-to-
Nitrogen Ratio
Variable, often 20:1 to 40:1 depending 
on animal type and bedding
Balanced, ideally 30:1 (adjusted by mixing 
green and brown materials)
Moisture Content
High, often 60-80% due to urine and 
fresh dung
Moderate, 40-60% (maintained for optimal 
microbial activity)
Microbial 
Activity
Contains native microbes from animal 
gut; may include pathogens if not 
composted
Diverse aerobic microbes (bacteria, fungi); 
pathogens reduced through heat
Additional Inputs
May include feed residues, farm 
waste, or soil from barns
May include manure, garden soil, or compost 
activators (e.g., molasses)
Processing
Often minimally processed; may be 
aged or composted
Actively managed with turning/aeration to 
ensure oxygen supply
Odor
Strong, ammonia-like if fresh; 
reduced if aged
Earthy, minimal odor if properly aerated
Pathogens/Weeds
May contain pathogens or weed seeds 
if not properly composted
Pathogens and weed seeds typically destroyed 
due to high temperatures (131-160Â°F)
Answer: The addition of farmed manure and biogas plant slurry is meaningless in the PQNK farming system. The roots of cover 
crops, whose growth is part of the conversion process, along with crop residues, are sufficient to open soil pores, increase aeration 
and water infiltration, enhance organic matter, and provide habitat for microorganisms to function properly. However, aerobic 
compost, when applied correctly, can rapidly promote the growth of diversified aerobic microbes.  
A ratio of up to ten tons of farmyard manure is too little; furthermore, it contains native microbes from animal gut flora, which 
include harmful pathogens. Everything else becomes meaningless debris due to water inundation and the higher temperatures of 
exposed soil in conventional systems.
PQNK is the self-sustaining food production system designed by nature that 
has been working for 400 million years without depleting any resources
