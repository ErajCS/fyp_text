 
Transforming Agriculture: Moving Beyond Incremental 
Change Toward Nature-Aligned Farming 
Agriculture has evolved over centuries, with each generation introducing improvements to 
increase yield and reduce labor. Just as humans moved from walking to horses, then to bicycles, 
cars, and finally aircraft for transportation, farming practices have also progressed in stages. Each 
step served its time and purpose. 
Rice cultivation traditionally relied on water accumulation in lowlands. In irrigated areas, water 
was introduced artificially, keeping soils moist to encourage better tillering. This method gave 
rise to practices that improved upon the traditional, including the widely adopted techniques of 
SRI (System of Rice Intensification), which proposed less inundation and better spacing for 
increased productivity. 
While such improvements helped many farmers, especially smallholders, they represent only 
incremental change. Much of the push for these methods came with large-scale funding—shaping 
how these practices were presented and adopted. Yet, despite their short-term success, these 
improvements do not address the deeper challenges that modern agriculture faces: soil 
degradation, excessive water use, poor microbial health, declining nutritional value of food, and 
rising costs. 
The Role of Natural Design 
Nature does not operate on human assumptions. Plants have evolved with specific root shapes, 
leaf sizes, and growth patterns suited to particular climates and ecosystems. Rice, though grown 
in water for centuries, does not need to be constantly inundated. In fact, plants grown on raised 
beds—where water is regulated and root zones remain aerated—produce more tillers and 
healthier yields. This indicates that the constant flooding of fields is not optimal for rice or the 
soil. 
Water that flows past the roots without being absorbed is not only wasted, it weakens plants, 
damages soil biology, and leads to long-term environmental harm. Moisture should be managed 
to mimic natural ecosystems where roots breathe, microbes thrive, and nutrients are exchanged in 
balance. 
PQNK: A Regenerative Solution 
The Paedar Qudratti Nizam Kashatqari (PQNK - ﭘﻘﻨﮏ) system is rooted in understanding natural 
soil-plant-water interactions. It avoids artificial chemical inputs and mechanization that harm soil 
structure. Importantly, it is not driven by donor funding or institutional pressure, which often 
influence research outcomes to suit specific agendas. PQNK is self-funded, farmer-tested, and 
field-proven. 
Research driven by donor expectations tends to favor polished presentations over on-ground 
realities. Intermediary operators market “sellable” ideas with credible names and strategic 
branding, often misrepresenting data to attract funding. This cycle has contributed to the ongoing 
crisis in agriculture—rising input costs, unhealthy soil, and declining rural livelihoods. 
Turning the Tide 
Despite these challenges, PQNK is inspiring a new wave of farmer-led regeneration. Youth from 
farming families are returning to the land, achieving better yields, and producing nutritionally 
rich food at lower costs. 
The critical question now is whether we continue with minor adjustments or embrace holistic, 
science-based systems that align with nature’s principles. 
Two Key Actions for Agricultural Transformation: 
1. Break the hardpan created by machines to restore the natural water cycle. 
2. Maintain healthy soil temperature to prevent land and planetary overheating. 
We are at a turning point. Just as past civilizations had to choose between survival and collapse, 
our generation must decide whether to follow extractive methods or adopt regenerative systems 
like PQNK that have sustained ecosystems for over 400 million years.
